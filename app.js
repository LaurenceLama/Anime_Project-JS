// we get anime api's from Jikan, I need to request to get an api data, How? Idk how, pls know it on the next line (6:15pm feb.7)
// lost track on finding the right line to request, but we now know HOW to do it 7:38pm , next is the what line to request
FINALLY, https://api.jikan.moe/v4/anime/{id}/full , I have staring at this copy paste code AND IT DOES NOT WORK THE FIRST TIME, BUT ITS ALL GOOD I AM NOT MAD JUST 
// DO this: basically that {id} has to be replaced with a Number(calling the id inside the api storage itself)
// if DO this does not work: what I did was to copy everything before {id} and start from there(putting a number I menubar, also not all numbers work but yeah, Imma learn how to call the 'anime' itself [if possible]) 8:26pm
